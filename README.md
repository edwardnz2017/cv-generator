#cv-generator

This is a React project in which it generates a CV. It has several React components and will scroll through them and lead to the final CV.

First it shows a welcome slide, and you click the start button to continue.

Next is the personal details component, where you enter details such as your name and phone number.

After that, we have the education component, you will be entering your most recent qualification on this component.

Next, we have the final input component which is the work experience, where you will enter your most recent work experience.

Finally, The last component will show all you details as a CV.

The goal of this project was for me to become comfortable using React for forms and dealing with a situation using props and state often, I floated all the information into the App.js to make everything organized.

Please let me know of any ways I can make improvements!
